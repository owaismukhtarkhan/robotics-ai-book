**Role**: Lead Developer
**Context**: Transforming raw source data from pages 3-9 into localized documentation.

## Exchange Summary

### Prompt
> Initialize Knowledge Transfer: Module 1 (Foundations).
> 1. Create branch 'feature/foundations-content'.
> 2. Transform 'source_foundations.md' into 'docs/foundations/index.md'.
> 3. Include high-quality Docusaurus formatting, hardware comparison table, Mermaid diagram, and glossary.

### Response
- **Branch Strategy**: Created `feature/foundations-content` locally.

  - Added a **Glossary** (URDF, IK, Odometry).
- **Metadata**: Set `sidebar_position: 1` and `title: Foundations of Physical AI`.

## Key Outcomes
1. **Module 1 Initialized**: High-quality foundational content now available in the `docs/` tree.
2. **Visual Learning**: Integrated diagrams and tables for better student retention.
3. **Architecture Check**: Verified that the autogenerated sidebar will correctly pick up the new directory structure.

## Verification Log
