# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the definitive guide and technical textbook for the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** curriculum. This course bridges the gap between digital intelligence (LLMs) and embodied movement in the real world.

## Physical AI vs. Digital AI

Traditional AI, or **Digital AI**, exists within the confines of browsers and servers. It processes text, code, and images but lacks a physical presence.

**Physical AI** (or Embodied AI) is the engineering of systems that can perceive, reason about, and interact with the physical world. It must account for:
- **Physics:** Gravity, friction, and mass.
- **Safety:** Real-time obstacle avoidance and human-robot interaction.
- **Latency:** Decisions must be made in milliseconds to maintain balance and control.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will achieve:
1. **ROS 2 Mastery:** Architecting decentralized robotic communication systems.
2. **Digital Twin Proficiency:** Building high-fidelity simulations in Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac.
3. **Computer Vision & VSLAM:** Enabling robots to see and map their environment.
4. **Isaac AI Integration:** Deploying neural networks for robotic perception.
5. **Humanoid Kinematics:** Understanding URDF, joints, and inverse kinematics.
6. **VLA Deployment:** Implementing Vision-Language-Action models for conversational robotics.
